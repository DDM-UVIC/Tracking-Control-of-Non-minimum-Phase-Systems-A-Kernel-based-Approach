# Tracking-Control-of-Non-minimum-Phase-Systems-A-Kernel-based-Approach

The "Codes.rar" file is the source code of the paper with the same title of the repository title. The file consists of Matlab codes of the new kernel method and filtered basis function 
method, which we used to compare with the kernel method. In the kernel code, there arefull preview and limited preview codes, as well as the data file which are uploaded in the code. 
The data file is not a special data from external source, and in fact, they are the results of filtered basis function code, and some simulations of kernel code that we got previously,
and just load them to get the plots in the kernel method codes. In other words, you can extract those data directly yourself from the existing codes.
